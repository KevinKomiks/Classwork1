**File Setup: Using a text editor, create two files:**

Deposits.txt: This file should contain the following deposit amounts, each on a separate line:

> 100.00

> 125.00

> 78.92

> 37.55

Withdrawals.txt: This file should contain the following withdrawal amounts, each on a separate line:

> 29.88

> 110.00

> 27.52

> 50.00

> 12.90

**Program Requirements: Write a program that performs the following tasks:**

Create an instance of the provided SavingsAccount class, initializing it with a starting balance of $500.00.
Read the values from Deposits.txt, store them in an array, and use the SavingsAccount class's method to add each amount to the account balance.

Similarly, read the values from Withdrawals.txt, store them in an array, and use the SavingsAccount class's method to subtract each amount from the account balance.

Calculate the monthly interest using the appropriate method from the SavingsAccount class.

Display the ending balance and the total interest earned for the month.

Output: The program should output:

The final balance after all deposits, withdrawals, and interest have been applied.

The total interest earned for the month.
